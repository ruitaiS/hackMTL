## Hack Montreal Puzzles

I recently started following the Hack MTL Facebook page, where they regularly post programming related puzzles. Since I'm trying to spend more time coding and less time looking at stuff on the internet, I've decided that every time I come across one of these puzzles on my Facebook feed, I'll stop internetting until I've solved it.
