## Question:
In how many ways can you place a 2 member subset of the set {1, 2 , ..., 10} on the remaining 3 vertices of a square such that two adjacent vertices have exactly one common member and non-adjacent vertices have no common members.
For this question: one of vertices of square holds {1, 2}.

## Answer:

Since one vertex is already set, if we pick another point (x, y) to be our second vertex, the third and fourth points will be determined by the following formulas:

f(x, y) =
