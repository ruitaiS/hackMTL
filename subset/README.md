## Question:
In how many ways can you place a 2 member subset of the set {1, 2 , ..., 10} on the remaining 3 vertices of a square such that two adjacent vertices have exactly one common member and non-adjacent vertices have no common members.
For this question: one of vertices of square holds {1, 2}.
